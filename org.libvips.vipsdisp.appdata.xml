    <p>
vipsdisp can display huge (many, many GB) images quickly and without using much memory. 

As well as the usual PNG, JPG, TIF, PDF, SVG, WEBP, JP2K, JXL and GIF,
it supports many scientific and technical image formats, including SVS,
MRXS, OpenEXR, FITS, Matlab, NIfTI, Analyze, PFM, etc.

vipsdisp supports pixel types from 1 bit mono to 128-bit double precision
complex, you can convert image formats, and it has a range of useful
visualisation options and display modes.
