/* LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE
 *
 * @s1 and @s2 are character arrays of size @n1 and @n2, which represent two
 * strings. Any null bytes are treated like a normal character, so strings
 * without a terminating null byte are valid input.
 *
 * The LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE between @s1 and @s2 is the smallest number of
 * insertions, deletions, or substitutions needed to transform @s1 into @s2.
 *
 * The algorithm dynamically builds a table T[n1+1]][n2+1] where the (x, y)
 * entry is the LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE between the prefix of @s1 of size y-1 and
 * the prefix of @s2 of size x-1.
 *
 * This implementation uses only a single @v column, updating it in place,
 * since only the elements at (x-1, y-1) and (x, y-1) are needed to compute
 * the element at (x, y). When the three costs defined by this dynamic
 * algorithm are equal to 1, this is expressed by the recursion relation:
 *
 *	k = (s1[y-1] == s2[x-2] ? 0 : 1)
 *
 * 	T[x][y] = MIN3( T[x-1][y] + 1, T[x][y - 1] + 1, T[x-1][y-1] + k )
 *
 * If we let @t1 hold the previous diagonal value, we can rewrite this
 * in terms of the single column @v:
 *
 *	k = (s1[y-1] == s2[x-2] ? 0 : 1)
 *
 * 	v[y] = MIN3( v[y] + 1, v[y-1] + 1, t1 + k )
 *
 * This array @v is reusable, so it can be allocated beforehand.
 *
 * The first column of the table T is unused, and the first row is
 * used as the base case for the recursion relation.

 * @t1:	Most recent diagonal value
 * @k:	Test inqeuality in s1[y-1] and s2[x-1], the pair of characters
 * 	corresponding to the table entry T[x][y]. Equals 0 if these characters
 *	are equal, and 1 if they are different.

/* The insertion, deletion, and substitution costs are set to allow for long
 * strings containing matches that are only a few deletions and/or
 * substitutions away from any position. There is 0 cost for inserting
 * characters to shift the smaller pattern toward the end in order to almost
 * match with a substring near the end of the longer string.
 *
 * This is ideal for the use case in the Properties widget (the only use
 * case), where it is used to suggest inexact matches as a user types,
 * whenever no exact matches are available for the current search pattern.
 *
 * The point is to be forgiving. The costs are not high for deletion and
 * insertion, but insertion cost is zero. The cost of swapping two
 * adjacent letters is DEL_COST + INS_COST = 1 + 0 = 1, so the costs of
 * all common mistakes are balanced except insertion, which is free.
 *
 * This allows the user to type quickly without worrying about small mistakes.
 *
 * The costs can be tweaked for other use cases if they arise.
